# üåê Muhammad Zahid | Developer Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, as part of my ongoing full-stack development journey. I‚Äôve started learning through online resources such as youtube, 100Devs, and I‚Äôm preparing for **AZNext Web Developer Program** ASU (July 2025 cohort).

## What This Project Is

- A responsive portfolio showcasing my background, certifications, current skills, and personal projects
- Designed to be clean, readable, mobile-friendly, and easy to maintain (with comments)
- Also used as a place to test out new things, layout tweaks, new HTML tags, JavaScript logic, and anything else I break while learning

## What I Learned

### GitHub: From Copy-Paste to Cloning Repos

I started out writing code in **Visual Studio Code**, then would manually copying and paste into GitHub‚Äôs web editor. It worked, but it wasn't efficient and required too many steps.

Additionally, when GitHub asked for a commit message before pushing that looked like a filename, I assumed it might overwrite or create a duplicate file, a beginner mistake, but upon further investigation learned it helps keeps a log.

Eventually I installed **GitHub Desktop**, learned how to clone my repository locally, and started pushing directly from VS Code. Writing clear commit messages also helped me track changes better.

Understanding that workflow early saved time and helped me feel more in control of versioning.

### Fixing Weird Alignment Was Weirdly Educational

The ‚ÄúCurrently Learning‚Äù section refused to line up with the rest of the content. What looked like a small CSS issue ended up teaching me a lot about:

- How inline vs block elements behave
- The importance of consistent HTML structure
- The effects of default margin and padding
- HTML vaidated using https://validator.w3.org/

Eventually I got it working the way I wanted. Small win, but it came with a solid CSS lesson I won‚Äôt forget.

## Final Thoughts

This repo is my portfolio, workspace, and learning log in one place.

Coming from a clinical and academic background, I‚Äôve learned that precision, systems thinking, and documentation all matter. Turns out those same principles apply to code too.

I'm not aiming for perfect code but I'm building a process I can trust, improve, and scale. Every code bug, fix, and push is part of learning and leveling up. I‚Äôm here to learn effeciently, solve real problems, and contribute.
